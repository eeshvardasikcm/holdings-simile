# `holdings-simile` 0.1.0.beta12
holdingsSimile is a part of the <b>AyurProject Language</b>. Holdings Simile is released here with most implementation still remaining private and not released. Holdings Simile (holdings-simile) is copyrighted 2023 by EeshvarDasIKCM.
## `Simile` concept
Similes are used in <b>AyurProject Language</b> similar to how generics are used in managed code languages. Right now, <i>holdingsSimile</i> is mostly a poetic opening because there are yet no concrete similes that ring true for my intent for the <i>holdings-simile</i>.
## versioning
Header files sufficiently describe the current state of <i>holdings-simile</i> and the private dependent parts of the <b>AyurProject Language</b> today.
## `Similar` concept
The concept of the keyword naming concept <i>Similar</i>, represents an evolution of the original defining concepts of <b>AyurProject Language</b>. <i>Simile</i> means that the keyword is not to be taken literally. The keyword operates similarly to the english meaning of the keyword.
