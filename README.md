# `holdings-simile` 0.2.0.beta1
holdingsSimile is a part of the <b>ayurvedaAndProjectManagement Language</b>. Holdings Simile is released here with most implementation still remaining private and not released. Holdings Simile (holdings-simile) is copyrighted 2023 by EeshvarDasIKCM.
## `Simile` concept
Similes are used in <b>ayurvedaAndProjectManagement Language</b> similar to how generics are used in managed code languages. Right now, <i>holdingsSimile</i> is mostly a poetic opening because there are yet no concrete similes that ring true for my intent for the <i>holdings-simile</i>.
## versioning
Header files sufficiently describe the current state of <i>holdings-simile</i> and the private dependent parts of the <b>ayurvedaAndProjectManagement Language</b> today.
### 0.2.0.beta1
The concept is clear enough in the use of the article package. Editing and better organizing the strings of text may happen before 0.2.0.rc1. The article class may be only partially included in the future to hide the further development of the bootstrap web generator.
### 0.1.0.rc1
The concepts are clear enough in this rc1. Twelve beta releases has been enough to steer this project in the intended direction. The Bootstrap html code was added during beta, remains a guideline for ongoing development, and will likely be functional for 0.2.0.beta1. The whole `holdings-simile` should be functional for 0.2.0.beta1. 
## `Similar` concept
The concept of the keyword naming concept <i>Similar</i>, represents an evolution of the original defining concepts of <b>ayurvedaAndProjectManagement Language</b>. <i>Simile</i> means that the keyword is not to be taken literally. The keyword operates similarly to the english meaning of the keyword.
